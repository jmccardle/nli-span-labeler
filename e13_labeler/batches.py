"""
Batch lifecycle and labelling design (requirements FR-31, FR-32).

Owner decision, 2026-10-05: "3 is ideal, but we might have to make 1 work."
Three ways to get agreement data, from best to fallback:

1. ``overlap_target`` 2-3: every item gets that many different labelers.
2. ``overlap_target`` 1 with a **reliability subset**: a deterministic sample of
   ``reliability_fraction`` of the items gets ``reliability_overlap`` labelers,
   the rest get one. α comes from the subset; single-labelled items are training
   data only.
3. A **re-label batch** (``relabel_of``): the same labeler labels a sample of
   their own items again, blind, after ``relabel_after_days``. This is the only
   option with a single labeler. It gives intra-rater α, which must be reported
   apart from inter-rater α (and alongside human-vs-committee α, FR-9).
